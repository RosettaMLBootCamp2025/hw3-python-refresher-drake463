# HW3: Python Refresher

## Overview

This assignment is designed as a Python refresher for biologists and bioinformaticians who may be a bit rusty. You'll complete a series of small exercises that build up to creating a simple sequence analysis tool. This assignment should take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete.

**IMPORTANT:** Each Python file contains function templates with `TODO` comments. Your job is to fill in the missing code where you see `# TODO:` comments. The scripts won't work until you complete the TODO sections!

You will:
1. Practice basic Python fundamentals
2. Write functions for biological sequence analysis
3. Read and parse FASTA files
4. Combine everything into a sequence analysis tool

## Prerequisites

- HW1 completed (Python environment set up)

## How to Complete This Assignment

Each Python file is a template with incomplete functions. Look for `# TODO:` comments - these mark where you need to write code. Read the docstrings and hints carefully, then implement the missing functionality.

**The scripts will not work until you complete the TODO sections!**

### Part 1: Python Basics Warmup (basics.py)

Open `basics.py` and **fill in the TODO sections** for these exercises:
- `reverse_string()` - Write a function to reverse a string
- `count_characters()` - Use a for loop to count characters in a string
- `amino_acid_composition()` - Create a dictionary to calculate amino acid percentages
- `filter_sequences_by_length()` - Use a list comprehension to filter sequences

**To test your work:**
```bash
conda activate bootcamp2025_HW1
python basics.py
```

If you see `None` or errors, you haven't completed all the TODOs yet!

### Part 2: Sequence Utilities (sequence_utils.py)

Open `sequence_utils.py` and **implement the TODO sections** for these bioinformatics functions:
- `molecular_weight()` - Calculate the molecular weight of a protein
- `count_hydrophobic()` - Count hydrophobic amino acids
- `find_motif()` - Find all positions of a motif in a sequence
- `count_charged_residues()` - Count positive and negative charges

**To test your work:**
```bash
python sequence_utils.py
```

The test cases at the bottom will only work once you've filled in all the TODOs!

### Part 3: FASTA File Parsing (read_fasta.py)

Open `read_fasta.py` and **complete the TODO sections** to:
- `read_fasta()` - Read and parse a FASTA file, storing sequences in a dictionary (header â†’ sequence)
- `print_fasta_stats()` - Print basic statistics about the sequences

**To test your work:**
```bash
python read_fasta.py sample.fasta
```

You should see information about each protein sequence. If not, check your TODOs!

### Part 4: Sequence Analysis Tool (analyze_sequence.py)

Open `analyze_sequence.py` and **fill in the TODO sections** to create a complete analysis script:
- `analyze_sequences()` - Use your sequence_utils functions to analyze each protein
- `write_results()` - Write the analysis results to a file

This part brings together everything from Parts 1-3!

**To run your completed analysis:**
```bash
python analyze_sequence.py sample.fasta
```

This should create an `analysis_results.txt` file with your results. If it doesn't work, you're missing some TODOs!

## Submission

Once you've completed all exercises and generated the output file, commit your work:

```bash
# Add all your completed Python files and the output
git add basics.py sequence_utils.py read_fasta.py analyze_sequence.py analysis_results.txt

# Commit your work
git commit -m "Complete Python refresher exercises"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## Tips

- **Test frequently**: Run your code after each function to catch errors early
- **Use print statements**: Debug by printing intermediate values
- **Read the TODO comments carefully**: They contain hints and requirements
- **Don't worry about edge cases**: Focus on getting the basic functionality working
- **Ask for help**: If you're stuck, reach out!

## Expected Output

When you run `analyze_sequence.py`, you should see output similar to:

```
Analyzing sequences from sample.fasta...

Sequence: gene_example_1
  Length: 120 bp
  GC Content: 45.83%
  Reverse Complement: CGATCG...

Results written to analysis_results.txt
```
